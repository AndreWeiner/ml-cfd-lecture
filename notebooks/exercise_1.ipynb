    "# Setting up your system\n",

    "## Getting access to a Linux-based operating system\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential to have access to a Linux-based operating system (OS) to do the exercises. If you already do have access to Linux and know how to use it, feel free to skip the remainder of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principal, there are three ways to get access to Linux:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Linux alongside your main OS. When starting up your device, you will be able to choose which OS to start via a so-called boot manager. You get a fully functioning Linux installation that does not interfere with your main OS. The available storage of your hard drive will be split between both OSs according to your preferred ratio. I recommend to give the Linux partition at least 50GB of size.\n",
    "2. Replace the main OS of your laptop or PC with Linux. Maybe you have an old laptop or workstation, which you don't really need any longer for your day-to-day tasks.\n",
    "3. Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL); this option is the most convenient to set up, but the practical use is a little bit more challenging because the WSL does not have the full set of features and is slower than a native Linux installation. Moreover, it is important to use **WSL 2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, I recommend [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) as your first Linux-based OS. Find below several links that guide you through your preferred installation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [installing Ubuntu alongside another OS](https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-1404-dual-boot-mode-windows-8-81-uefi/)\n",
    "2. [installing Ubuntu as your only OS](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview)\n",
    "3. [installing Ubuntu via WSL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Git and clone the course material\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install git via the command line by opening up a new terminal window (press Ctrl+Alt+T if you have a native installation) and typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt install git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most likely, Git is already installed on your system. It is also good practice to set up your user name and email:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git config --global user.name \"John Doe\"\n",
    "git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more on setting up Git in [this article](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup). Now you are ready to clone the GitHub repository containing the course material. Navigate to the directory where you would like to keep the repository and execute:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:AndreWeiner/ml-cfd-lecture.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now you can navigate into the repository and create a folder, in which you can do the exercises:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd ml-cfd-lecture\n",
    "mkdir exercises\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the folder must be named exactly in this way because Git will ignore everything happening in that folder. You can create new files, notebooks, or simulations without interfering with the rest of the repository. Otherwise, you may get in trouble when pulling the latest updates from GitHub. Every once in a while, the remote repository (on GitHub) might change and you also want to update your local version of the repository. The command to receive the latest updates is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# you must be at the top-level of the ml-cfd-lecture repository before executing this command\n",
    "git pull\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now you already know enough about Git and GitHub to follow this course. However, if you would like to learn how powerful these tools really are, you can take [this free online course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Python\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Ubuntu is shipped with two versions of Python - Python 2 and Python 3. We will be using exclusively **Python 3**. Moreover, we use a small tool called *pip* to install the required Python libraries from the Python Package Index (PyPI). To install pip, run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt install python3-pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "The required packages are listed in the file *requirements.txt*, and you can install all of them at once by running the command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "To check if the installation was successful, type the following commands and observe if your output matches the one displayed below:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3\n",
    "# now you are in an interactive Python shell indicated by >>>\n",
    ">>> import torch as pt # press enter\n",
    ">>> pt.__version__     # press enter\n",
    "'1.9.0+cu111'          # your output might vary slightly; the version should match\n",
    "# to leave the shell, press Crtl+D\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter lab\n",
    "\n",
    "If you followed the instructions above, jupyter lab is already installed on your system. To get a feeling for Jupyter labs, create a new Python 3 notebook and try to create and execute one code and one Markdown cell. Cells are executed by pressing Crtl+Shift+Enter. You can change the cell type using the dropdown menu at the center-top of the notebook. Here are some commands to get you started:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd exercises\n",
    "jupyter-lab\n",
    "# now your web browser should open up\n",
    "# 1. in the Notebook section, click on Python 3\n",
    "# 2. in the file browser on the left side, right-click and the new notebook and rename it\n",
    "# 3. change the type of the first cell to Markdown\n",
    "# 4. type '# My first Notebook' and press Crtl+Shift+Enter\n",
    "# 5. in the next cell, type 'print(\"Hello Jupyter\")' and press Ctrl+Shift+Enter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with WSL, the command to [fire up a new notebook](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62353890/windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-2-and-jupyter-lab-how-to-open-a-jupyter-note) is slightly more complex. You will start the notebook **inside** the WSL but display it in your default Windows web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instal ParaView\n",
    "\n",
    "The installation of ParaView on Ubuntu is straightforward. Execute the command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt install paraview\n",
    "```\n",
    "When working with WSL, it is best to install ParaView directly on Windows. The executable can be downloaded [here](https://www.paraview.org/paraview-downloads/download.php?submit=Download&version=v5.9&type=binary&os=Windows&downloadFile=ParaView-5.9.1-Windows-Python3.8-msvc2017-64bit.exe). Since you are able to see the WSL files from Windows, you can navigate to the corresponding folder and start ParaView to post-process simulation data produced inside WSL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Singularity\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Singularity, follow [these instruction](https://sylabs.io/guides/master/user-guide/quick_start.html) until the section *Overview of the SingularityCE Interface*. The installation guides you through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. installation of dependencies available via the Ubuntu package manager\n",
    "2. compiling Go (a programming language similar to C)\n",
    "3. compiling Singularity\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if the installation process went well, run the following command and see if you get the expected output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "singularity run library://lolcow\n",
    "#\n",
    "# this is the output you should see\n",

    "A good code editor can make your life significantly easier. VS code is an open-source editor with an excellent package management system to install extensions for different types of technologies and programming languages. The editor also makes suggestions for completion as you start to write code, shows the code's documentation, and indicates potential issue even before you compile or execute the program (a process called *linting*). To install VS code on Ubuntu, type:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo snap install --classic code\n",
    "```\n",
    "Setting up VS code in WSL is slightly more complex. Instructions can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl).\n",
