    "# Setting up your system\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting access to a Linux-based operating system\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential to have access to a Linux-based operating system (OS) to do the exercises. If you already do have access to Linux and know how to use it, feel free to skip the remainder of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principal, there are three ways to get access to Linux:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Linux alongside your main OS. When starting up your device, you will be able to choose which OS to start via a so-called boot manager (typically [Grub](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/)). You get a fully functioning Linux installation that does not interfere with your main OS. The available storage of your hard drive will be split between both OSs according to your preferred ratio. I recommend to give the Linux partition at least 50GB of size.\n",
    "2. Replace the main OS of your laptop or PC with Linux. Maybe you have an old laptop or workstation, which you don't really need any longer for your day-to-day tasks.\n",
    "3. Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL); this option is the most convenient to set up, but the practical use is a little bit more challenging because the WSL does not have the full set of features and is slower than a native Linux installation. Moreover, it is important to use **WSL 2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, I recommend [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) as your first Linux-based OS. Find below several links that guide you through your preferred installation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [installing Ubuntu alongside another OS](https://itsfoss.com/install-ubuntu-1404-dual-boot-mode-windows-8-81-uefi/)\n",
    "2. [installing Ubuntu as your only OS](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview)\n",
    "3. [installing Ubuntu via WSL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Git and clone the course material\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install the version control tool [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) via the command line by opening up a new terminal window (press Ctrl+Alt+T if you have a native installation) and typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt install git\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you start from a fresh installation and Git or other packages are not found in the list of available packages, you may have to update the package list by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt update\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most likely, Git is already installed on your system. It is also good practice to set up your user name and email as the very first step:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git config --global user.name \"John Doe\"\n",
    "git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more on setting up Git in [this article](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup). Now you are ready to clone the GitHub repository containing the course material. Navigate to the directory where you would like to keep the repository and run the clone command. Note that it is important to store the repository somewhere inside your **home folder**. Otherwise, you may encounter problems when working with the Apptainer images.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/AndreWeiner/ml-cfd-lecture.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now you can navigate into the repository and create a folder, in which to complete exercises:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd ml-cfd-lecture\n",
    "mkdir exercises\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the folder must be named exactly in this way because Git will ignore everything happening in that folder. You can create new files, notebooks, or simulations without interfering with the rest of the repository. Otherwise, you may get in trouble when pulling the latest updates from GitHub. Every once in a while, the remote repository (on GitHub) might change and you also want to update your local version of the repository. The command to receive the latest updates is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# you must be at the top-level of the ml-cfd-lecture repository before executing this command\n",
    "git pull\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now you already know enough about Git and GitHub to follow this course. However, if you would like to learn how powerful these tools really are, you can take [this free online course](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Python\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Ubuntu 22.04 is shipped with Python 3.10.6, but any version $\\ge$ 3.8 should work without problems. Python is a very popular programming language and maybe you are already using several Python libraries for other projects. To avoid version conflicts between the libraries used in this course and any other libraries installed in the past or future, we use a dedicated [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). Venv is available via the standard package manager:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt install python3-venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "You may have several versions of the Python interpreter installed on your system. You can get a list of available versions by running the command `ls -al /usr/bin/python3*`. To distinguish between different versions of the interpreter, the version is typically appended to the basename *python*, e.g., *python3.8*. In the latter case, replace the installation command above with:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt install python3.8-venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "To create a new environment called *ml-cfd*, run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -m venv ml-cfd\n",
    "# or in case of python3.8\n",
    "python3.8 -m venv ml-cfd\n",
    "```\n",
    "The typical environment usage looks as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# activate the environment\n",
    "source ml-cfd/bin/activate\n",
    "# now are inside the environment and can install new libraries or run programs\n",
    "# you should notice an additional (ml-cfd) prefix in the command line\n",
    "# deactivate to leave the environment\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we use a small tool called *pip* to install the required Python libraries from the Python Package Index (PyPI). To install pip, run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt install python3-pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "The required packages for this course are listed in the file *requirements.txt*, and you can install all of them at once into the *ml-cfd* environment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# activate the environment\n",
    "source ml-cfd/bin/activate\n",
    "# make sure that the latest version of pip is installed\n",
    "pip install --upgrade pip\n",
    "# install dependencies\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "To check if the installation was successful, type the following commands and observe if your output matches the one displayed below:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python\n",
    "# now you are in an interactive Python shell indicated by >>>\n",
    ">>> import torch as pt # press enter\n",
    ">>> pt.__version__     # press enter\n",
    "'1.12.1+cpu'           # your output might vary slightly; the version should match\n",
    "# to leave the Python shell, press Crtl+D\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter labs\n",
    "\n",
    "If you followed the instructions above, jupyter lab is already installed in the *ml-cfd* environment. To get a feeling for Jupyter labs, create a new Python 3 notebook and try to create and execute one code and one Markdown cell. Cells are executed by pressing Shift+Enter. You can change the cell type using the dropdown menu at the center-top of the notebook. Here are some commands to get you started:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# activate the Python environment\n",
    "source ml-cfd/bin/activate\n",
    "cd exercises\n",
    "jupyter-lab\n",
    "# now your web browser should open up\n",
    "# 1. in the Notebook section, click on Python 3\n",
    "# 2. in the file browser on the left side, right-click and the new notebook and rename it\n",
    "# 3. change the type of the first cell to Markdown\n",
    "# 4. type '# My first Notebook' and press Shift+Enter\n",
    "# 5. in the next cell, type 'print(\"Hello Jupyter\")' and press Shift+Enter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with WSL, the command to [fire up a new notebook](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62353890/windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-2-and-jupyter-lab-how-to-open-a-jupyter-note) is slightly more complex. You will start the notebook **inside** the WSL but display it in your default Windows web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install ParaView\n",
    "\n",
    "The installation of ParaView on Ubuntu is straightforward. Execute the command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# deactivate the Python environment before running this command\n",
    "sudo apt install paraview\n",
    "```\n",
    "When working with WSL, it is best to install ParaView directly on Windows. The executable can be downloaded [here](https://www.paraview.org/paraview-downloads/download.php?submit=Download&version=v5.10&type=binary&os=Linux&downloadFile=ParaView-5.10.1-MPI-Linux-Python3.9-x86_64.tar.gz). Since you are able to see the WSL files from Windows, you can navigate to the corresponding folder and start ParaView to post-process simulation data produced inside WSL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Apptainer\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Apptainer, follow [these instruction](https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer/blob/main/INSTALL.md) until completing the section *Compiling Apptainer*. You can skip the section *Install golangci-lint*. The installation guides you through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. installation of dependencies available via the Ubuntu package manager\n",
    "2. compiling Go (a programming language similar to C)\n",
    "3. compiling Apptainer\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if the installation process went well, run the following command and see if you get the expected output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "apptainer pull docker://ghcr.io/apptainer/lolcow\n",
    "apptainer run lolcow_latest.sif\n",
    "#\n",
    "# this is the output you should see\n",
