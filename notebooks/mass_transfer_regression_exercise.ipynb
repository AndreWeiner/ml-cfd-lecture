    "# Computing highly accurate mass transfer at rising bubbles\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise consists of two parts, which are meant to be solved in two individual exercise sessions. In the first part, we perform the two-phase flow simulation of a rising bubble and process the relevant data. In the second part, we create features, train ML models for velocity and shape, and deploy these models in a single-phase simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part I - two-phase flow simulation and data processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performing the two-phase flow simulation (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this application, the solver used in exercise 2 has been modified to output the interface velocity and orientation at regular intervals. Similar to exercise 2, the following commands compile the updated solver and perform the simulation of a rising bubble with ellipsoidal shape:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# start the Basilisk container located at the repository's top level\n",
    "apptainer shell basilisk.sif\n",
    "# copy the updated solver to the exercise folder\n",
    "Apptainer> cp -r test_cases/basilisk_solver/ exercises/\n",
    "# navigate to the source files and compile the solver\n",
    "Apptainer> cd exercises/basilisk_solver/\n",
    "Apptainer> make clean && make\n",

    "Apptainer> mpirun -np 4 ../bubble 14 15 0.4361 238.2 &> log.solver\n",
    "```\n",
    "With the above settings, the simulation may take up to two hours to complete depending on your system. You can also modify the Eötvös and Galilei numbers to change the bubble's behavior. However, keep in mind that the shape should become stable and convex with respect to the center of mass as the bubble reaches a steady state. Alteratively, you can download the latest *datasets* archive from the lecture's [repository](https://github.com/AndreWeiner/ml-cfd-lecture) and continue with the pre-computed simulation data. \n",

    "### Loading and processing velocity and shape information\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant data are distributed across two types of files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the log file *log.solver* contains the rise velocity and center of mass at every numerical time step\n",

    "The log file is a simple text-encoded file with table-like data. There is one row for each numerical time step and the meaning of the 9 columns is as follows:\n",

    "# time, volume, CoM x, CoM y, CoM z, CoMV x, CoMV y, CoMV z, area\n",
    "```\n",
    "The abbreviations above stand for *Center of Mass* (CoM) and *Center of Mass Velocity* (CoMV). Of these columns, we need only *time*, *CoM x* and *CoMV x*. Loading the log file data is complicated due to spurious rows contained in the log file. For example, there are several warning messages right at the beginning of the file:\n",

    "\n",

The snapshot number and the process id are encoded in the filename as *points_#######_n###.txt*, where the first 6 digits contain the snapshot number with leading zeros and the second 3 digits stand for the process id. For example, the file *points_000010_n000.txt* contains the data of the 11th snapshot written by process zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each file contains the x and y components of position, normal, and velocity vectors of discrete locations representing the gas-liquid interface.\n",
    "```\n",
    "# x, y, normal x, normal y, velocity x, velocity y\n",
    "```\n",
    "This time, there is no spurious information in the data, but the files contain empty lines, which have to be removed. Moreover, all files belonging to one snapshot have to be parsed individually and concatenated. The order in which the processor files are parsed and concatenated is not important. You may want to use the following two functions as abstractions for loading individual processor files and concatenating them:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def parse_processor_file(path: str) -> pt.Tensor:\n",
    "    with open(path, \"r\") as f:\n",
    "        # parse lines \n",

    "        p_data.append(\n",
    "            parse_processor_file(join(path, f\"points_{iteration:06d}_n{p:03d}.txt\"))\n",
    "        )\n",
    "    p_data = pt.cat(p_data)\n",
    "    return p_data[p_data[:, -1].abs() < 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "To parse the lines, you may find the string manipulation methods [strip](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip) and [split](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) helpful. The [map](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map) function is useful to apply a function to all elements in a list (an iterable) without explicitly writing loops."

Both position and velocity vectors are given in Cartesian coordinates.
