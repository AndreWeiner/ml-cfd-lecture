# Machine learning in computational fluid dynamics

This repository contains resources accompanying the lecture [machine learning in computational fluid dynamics](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/ism/teaching/courses/fluid-mechanics/translate-to-english-maschinelles-lernen-in-der-numerischen-stroemungsmechanik) provided by the Institute of Fluid Mechanics at TU Braunschweig. **Note that slides, notebooks, and other resources will be regularly updated throughout the term.**

## Lectures

If equations in the lecture notebooks do not get rendered properly on Github, download the notebook and open it using `jupyter-lab` (refer to the first exercise session for an overview of dependencies and installation instructions).

## Exercises

### Prerequisites

The exercises are designed for native Linux operating systems like Ubuntu (recommended). They may also work on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). To set up your system for the exercises, refer to the notebook accompanying exercise session 1.

## Datasets

Both exercises and lectures sometimes require datasets. Usually, there are instructions how to create or extract the data yourself. For convenience, a downloadable snapshot of the [latest data (20. Dec 2021)](https://cloudstorage.tu-braunschweig.de/getlink/fiYPP9HwVaypRziqMCjZuQVx/datasets_20_Dec_2021.zip) is provided, too.

## Getting and providing help and feedback

If you
- get stuck solving an exercise problem
- have technical issues
- have theoretical questions about math or programming
- think that some instructions or explanations might need improvement
- want to report typos or logical errors
- want to provide feedback and suggestions about the course

the easiest way to get in touch is to open a [new issue](https://github.com/AndreWeiner/ml-cfd-lecture/issues/new) in this repository. Before opening a new issue, please use the **search function** to see if a related issue was reported previously. It also helps greatly if you label your issue using one or more of the predefined labels (lecture, exercise, OpenFOAM, ...), and if you take some time to state your problem as clearly as possible. **Note that everyone is welcome to participate in discussion and solving issues.**

If you are a student at TU Braunschweig enrolled in the course *Machine Learning in Computational Fluid Dynamics*, you may also get in touch via the [studIP](https://studip.tu-braunschweig.de/dispatch.php/course/overview?cid=f79375e64fd07fe6606d810ab17496e7) platform or via mail. However, the issue-workflow described above is the preferred method.
